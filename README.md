# BitConverter
This is C++ Bit Converter, which provides conversion between byte array and
c++ datatypes. In addition, It provides conversion between std::bitset and 
byte array. <br>
<br>
The motive of this Bit Converter was the absence of bit converter in C++
like BitConverter, BitArray class in C#. So, it refers to C# classes, 
and tries to make the code independent of the platform. (e.g., Endianness)<br>
<br>
