# BitConverter
This is C++ utility to handle bit and byte sequence. <br>

### Bit Converter
It provides conversion between byte array and
c++ datatypes. <br>
In addition, It provides conversion between std::bitset and byte array. <br>
<br>
The motive of this Bit Converter was the absence of bit converter in C++ like BitConverter, BitArray class in C#. <br>
So, it refers to C# classes, and tries to make the code independent of the platform. (e.g., Endianness)<br>
<br>
